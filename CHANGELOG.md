# CHANGELOG

[Friends don't let friends dump git logs into changelogs.](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [3.5]

- Fix rotary encoder rotation accuracy 
- the font for "V", "T", "E"  has been updated
- the mod/matrix selection can now be exited after the last click through (toggling - turn on/off)
- representation of noise level is fixed
- initial representation of loaded preset number is fixed (which was also initially overridden by the detune parameter)
- the flashing is somewhat calmed down
- Voice & Noise matrix visual update:
 Active parts (channels/chips) flash faster, unactive parts (channels/chips) flash slower, when you are fiddling around inside the matrix.
